2. **OpenCV, Numpy, PIL**: Implementing the image recognition module for handling various image processing tasks.
3. **pyautogui, win32api, pynput**:
    - Facilitates mouse and keyboard input control.
    - Includes a Bezier curve function for smooth mouse trajectory movement.
4. **win32api**: Supports basic window and process functionalities.
5. **Paddle OCR**: Integrated OCR (Optical Character Recognition) functionality for text recognition in images.
6. **Fastdeploy with ONNX models**:
    - Enables efficient and streamlined object detection using ONNX models.
7. **SQLite**: Provides a lightweight database solution for data storage and management.
